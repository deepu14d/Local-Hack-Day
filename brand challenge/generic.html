			<p>Well, the title is bit awkward. I mean of course you love Anime and stuff related to it that's why you
				are here. Well, that's good.
				Welcome you all. <br />I am also an Anime lover just like you all guys. And it's not much but I am
				watching anime since a long time now. And now I am thinking
				that isn't it better if we can build a community where we can chat, talk, give recommendations, share
				drawings, share creative work and we can just do
				a lot of great things together. It's just a idea but now I amthinking to bring it in reality. Hope you
				guys will help me to build a community where we can do a lot of things.</p>

			</div>
			<p> So, I hope you guys can now undestand what I am trying to ask. Leave it now let's talk about other
				stuff.
				My favourite anime? Well, I almost like every anime I watch ðŸ˜… but still the genre that I usually like
				most is like that
				psychological, sci-fi, mystery, supernatural and then comes action, fantasy, adventure, shonen and
				others. Well, sorry to say but I don't usually like romance genre
				however I am not saying it's bad, I have watched some animes of this genre. I animes I have watched
				completely are Steins gate, Death Note, One punch man,
				Akame Ga Kill, DB series, Naruto, Plunderer, and many more I am unable to remeber right now. I alo love
				drawing anime photos, I am not that good
				but still I love drawing. Currently, I am wathing Attack On Titans new season and it's really lit. I am
				very excited for the next episode. It's hard to wait but what can I do?
			</p>

			<p> Can we move a lil bit away from Anime talk? Guess you answered 'Yes'. I am also a techie, geeky, and
				love space stuff. I want to do a lot of things in my lifetime and currently working on them. I love
				programming and trying to
				learn some new stuffs in this field too. I have a lot to do and I am really afraid how can I achieve
				those things that I want to achieve. But still I have to go on. I can't just stop here thinking about
				these things.
				<br /> That was sort of motivation. Right? Well, anime teach a lot of things and that was one of them.
				Stay Motivated and don't afraid from problems in your path to achieve your dreams.
				There's a lot I can still talk about but guess, that's enough. Maybe you ae also feeling bored. No
				problem,that's it. Time to go out.
				Bye-Bye. Sayonara.
